### About the Device

The FreeHand is a simple wrist-worn device enabling amputees and parapalegics to effeciently and easily make use of computer systems. The project is designed around inclusivity, making use of a gyroscope to translate hand movements into cursor motion, and twists of the wrist into clicks. In addition to the basic functionality of the device, we also added basic digital watch functionality to the device through a screen, displaying the time and date to make the device feel more like an everyday tool than a specialized medical device. All in all, the FreeHand helps bridge the gap faced by disabled individuals in computer usage, and propels the way forward in accessible technology. 


### Input:
The device takes in 2 areas of input- An on/off switch, allowing the user to easily power off the device when neccessary and a gyroscope that helps translate tilt, pitch and roll movements into real cursor motion. 
### Processing: 
The onboard XIAO ESP32 C3 processes gyroscope values, converting them into cursor motion and clicks through tilt parameters and the bLEmouse library. 
### Output: 
The board outputs cursor data to the Bluetooth connected host device.
